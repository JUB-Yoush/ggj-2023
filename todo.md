-- Todo--
- add roots (added the node and the collision, need to add functionality when in state) 
	- roots should put the player in a climbing state when they touch it
	- they can climb slowly up or down and jump off to cancel the state and go back to jumping
	- you aren't climbing on the root unless you're holding up
- add rocks
- add ants
-- DONE --
- ~~basic platformer controller~~
- ~~simple finite state machine:~~
	- on ground
	- in air
	- climbing
